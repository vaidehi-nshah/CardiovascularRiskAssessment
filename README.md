# CardiovascularRiskAssessment

### Dated:
Boston University, Fall 2022

### Description:
**DATASET:**
I obtained this dataset from the UCI directory under the area “Life”. It has 13 columns with 300 rows of data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records 

The dataset has a list of 13 clinical features. It includes quantitative data like the age of the patient, the levels of creatinine phosphokinase, serum creatinine and serum sodium in the blood, the percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction called the ejection fraction, the platelet count, and the follow-up time period of the patients. It also has a list of Boolean variables which is a “0” if the event is FALSE, and a “1” for when the event is TRUE. This includes columns like anemia, high blood pressure and diabetes, if the person is a smoker or not, and binary assignment of “0” for females and “1” for males for the gender of the patient.

### Achievements: 
● Utilized a UCI dataset comprising 300 instances and 12 features, including critical factors such as serum creatinine and ejection fraction, to drive insights for more effective cardiovascular risk assessment and patient care in healthcare sector 

● Implemented a Random Forest modeling approach to predict likelihood of heart failure. Achieved a predictive accuracy with an AUC of 90.3%, surpassing performance of Multiple Logistic Regression by 1%
